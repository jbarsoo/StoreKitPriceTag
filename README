The Apple App Store allows customers to purchase App content from within the App itself.  
SKPTBuyButton extends a UISegmentedControl to make it behave like a dynamic price tag.  
With it you can display the LIVE price of your App from within your App.

What good is this?
Apple allows developers to make up-to-the-minute (and scheduled) price changes to
in-app purchasable content.  Customers will not know of these changes unless they
attempt an in-app purchase.  StoreKitPriceTag shows the up-to-date price.

Implementation:
Include the files in your App,
Add the appropriate code to record customer purchases and to implement purchased content,
Replace the https://URL with that of your product server.
Your product server should return the Apple Product Identifier that Apple has approved
for use as an in-app purchase identifier.

Managed Object Context:
SKPTBuyButton expects a pre-existing NSManagedObjectContext object (see Apple's CoreData documentation)
